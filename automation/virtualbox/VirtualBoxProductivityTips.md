* Choose a good "Host key combination", preferably something simple but not used otherwise. On my
Sun Type 6 USB I use Compose key.
* Any time you're "locked" in the guest window, press the host-key (release it before you press
anything else, check the icon in the status line) and then Alt-Tab, Win-key, etc. works on the
host machine. This is the fastest way how to switch from host to guest and back, without even
grabbing a mouse.
* Win-key is tricky sometimes, first press of Win-key on the guest is often grabbed by both guest
and host. Just press it again and now only guest will get it. Good to get rid of host capturing
Win-key before you press Win+something else.
