# How to create virtual network with VirtualBox

Let's say I want to create mini-network with two computers:
* Windows Server 2012 acting as a domain controller,
* Windows 10 as a member of domain.

## Networking

We need to choose the right way of networking from: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html


### Internal networking

Very easy, for both machines select in VBox **Settings/Network**, tab **Adapter 1** networking type
(**Attached to**) of **Internal Network** and choose the same name, e.g. `testdomain`. In this case
host is not accessible from the guests.
 
Start both machines and use `ipconfig` to find their IPs and try to ping them. Out of box I could
ping Windows 10 from the other, not the other way around, because Windows Server 2012 has disabled
inbound ping. Follow [this](http://blog.blksthl.com/2012/11/20/how-to-enable-ping-in-windows-server-2012/)
to fix the problem or just use these PowerShell commands:

```
Import-Module NetSecurity
Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request â€“ ICMPv4-In)" -enabled True
```


### Host-only Adapter
 
Works similar like Internal networking, but host and guests are on the same network. Using
`ipconfig` on the host we can find **Ethernet adapter VirtualBox Host-Only Network** and see its
IP. Name of the adapter can be different, there can be multiple adapters as well -- this can be
set in **File/Preferences/Network**, tab **Host-only Networks**.

Note: it seems there is no way how to specify name of the host-only network and even command
line tool `VBoxManage hostonlyif create` merely creates network with fixed name and sequence
number in it. This makes it extremely ugly for "lab" testing.


### Problem VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND

We've got VirtualBox (5.0.10r104061) with `winserver2012` virtual machine in it. I created new
Host-only Network (File/Preferences, Network, tab Host-only Networks, button +) and used this
network for vitual machine (click on `winserver2012`, Settings, Network, tab Adapter 2, Enable,
Attached to: Host-only Adatper, Name: only one possible). During start of the virtual machine
following error occurs:
```
Failed to open a session for the virtual machine winserver2012_default_1454188297542_9145.

Failed to open/create the internal network 'HostInterfaceNetworking-VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter' (VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND).

Failed to attach the network LUN (VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND).

Result Code: E_FAIL (0x80004005)
Component: ConsoleWrap
Interface: IConsole {872da645-4a9b-1727-bee2-5585105b9eed}
```

I'm not sure whether it's 5.0.10 error, but I upgraded to to 5.0.14, restarted and it still
repeated. I removed the hostonly network and added it again, and the problem disappeared. However,
the new default hostonly network was setup without DHCP, this needs to be set up, typically with
the same netaddress (mask 255.255.255.0), with 100 for DHCP server, and IP pool 101-254. If the
guest is running, it requires shutdown and boot again (restart doesn't seem to work, it will not
see new DHCP). After this the hostonly networking seems running.

How to make this all in one sweep, I have no idea.


### Outside connectivity

If we want to leave NAT networking so the machines are not cut from the outside world (handy
for browsing, any downloads, updates, etc.) we may leave **Adapter 1** as is and set-up Internal
Network (or Host-only Adapter) on **Adapter 2** (or vice versa).


## Setting IPs

See also [domain controller lab](DomainControllerLab.md), part *Setting IP for host-only network*.
We might want static IPs. Do we want specific host-only network IP setup too or will we flexibly
use current network IP and just set up last number?
